  "description": "Our team has been developing the world leading process technology in Nanoimprint lithography(NIL) for production consideration. Since 2007, we successfully implemented NIL process onto high volume LED wafers, hard sapphire substrates and fragile InP laser wafers for production. With the unique developed process flow, our team has integrated NIL process into several industry standard processes to deliver the products with nano-structure inside. With decade experience in NIL, we are capable of manufacturing highly customized fine structures on different materials and keep elaborating our NIL technique to approach the quantum filed application."
